\section*{Message from the workshop chairs}


Welcome to the 14th Junior Researcher Workshop on Real-Time Computing, held in 
conjunction with the 29th International Conference on Real-Time and Network 
Systems (RTNS), April 2021. The workshop provides an informal 
environment for junior researchers, where they can present their ongoing work 
in a relaxed forum and engage in enriching discussions with other members of 
the real-time systems community.

We would like to take this opportunity to express our gratitude to the members 
of the Program Committee listed below for thoroughly reviewing all the 
submitted papers.  We would also like to thank all the authors who submitted 
their work to the workshop and hence contributed to its success.  We wish you 
success in your scientific careers and we hope that the workshop will help you 
develop your ideas further. This year, JRWRTC accepted five peer-reviewed 
papers,  which cover various topics of the real-time field such as scheduling, 
model checking, WCET analysis and vehicle networks. 


Yet, organizing this workshop would not have been possible 
without the help of many people. First,  we would like to thank Liliana 
Cucu-Grosjean, Steering Committee of RTNS 2021, for her guidance and advice in 
the organization of the workshop. We would also 
like to thank the General Chair, Audrey Queudet and the rest of the Local 
Organizing Committee, especially Sébastien Faucou, Jean-Luc Béchennec, and 
Mikaël Briday for having put their time in ensuring that all the details were 
smooth.

%We would also like 
%to thank Enrico Bini andClaire Pagetti, Program Chairs of RTNS 2017, for their 
%scientific work.  We finally acknowledgeGeoffrey Nelissen (CISTER, Portugal) 
%for his precious advice in the organization of the event.

On behalf of the 
Program Committee, we wish you a pleasant workshop. May the environmen tbe 
stimulating, with fruitful discussions and the presentation be enjoyable and 
entertaining
